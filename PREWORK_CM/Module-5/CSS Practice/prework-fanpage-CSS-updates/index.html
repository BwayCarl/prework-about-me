            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p><strong><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brecker" target="_blank">Michael Leonard Brecker</strong></a> 
                (March 29, 1949 – January 13, 2007) "was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was awarded 15 Grammy
                Awards as both performer and composer. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music 
                in 2004, and was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame in 2007."</p>
            <p>If you don't know him by name, it's almost certain you've heard him play in any of the music that you may listen to,
                as his career as a studio musician was prolific. Brecker played with a <a href="https://rockandrollparadise.com/michael-brecker-12007/" target="_blank">wide variety of artists</a>
                that included "Frank Zappa, Bette Midler, Bruce Springsteen, Carly Simon, Simon & Garfunkel, Bonnie Tyler, James Taylor, 
                Luther VanDross, Tina Turner, Ringo Starr, Billy Joel, Rick James, Jan Akkerman, Herbie Hancock, John Lennon, 
                Andy Gibb, Steely Dan, Elton John, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Frank Sinatra and Lou Reed." Altogether, he appeared on over 
                700 albums, either as a band member or a guest soloist.</p>
            <p>I first discovered Brecker as a co-leader with vibraphonist Mike Manieri in the jazz/fusion band <strong>Steps Ahead</strong> 
                in the mid-1980s as he began experimenting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWI_(musical_instrument)" target="_blank">EWI</a> 
                (electronic wind instrument) and just before he took his turn as a solo artist in 1987 with the self-titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Michael-Brecker/dp/B000V657EM/ref=tmm_msc_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1590900738&sr=8-2" target="_blank">"Michael Brecker"</a>.</p>
            <p>In early 2005, he was diagnosed with the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Despite a widely publicized 
                worldwide search, Brecker was unable to find a matching stem cell donor. In late 2005, he was the recipient of an 
                experimental partial matching stem cell transplant. By late 2006, he appeared to be recovering, but the treatment 
                proved not to be a cure. He made his final public performance on June 23, 2006, playing with Herbie Hancock at Carnegie Hall. 
                Brecker died from complications of leukemia in New York City. His funeral was held on January 15, 2007 in 
                Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.</p>
