      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Local One union stagehand in New York City and currently hold the position of House Electrian at
         the Booth Theatre.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in the Bronx, New York and grew up in Flushing, Queens, New York.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy sports and am an avid baseball fan (LET'S GO METS!). I love jazz music, 
        enjoy golf and also dabble at some basic woodworking, skills of which I'm trying to 
        hone with each project.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I basicallly already have my dream job. Being a house electrician on Broadway 
        gives you the opportunity to collaborate with designers and production staff
        to form new artistic endeavors with each new show. The excitement of putting on a live
        show each evening is like no other.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in South Orange, New Jersey with my wife of 13 years and two daughters, 
        ages 10 and 7.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Due to the current coronavirus pandemic, Broadway was forced to shut down along with all 
        other industries that require large gatherings and audiences. While we are closed for the 
        foreseeable future, I'm taking the opportunity to learn a new skill that is in demand, and
        hopefully turn it into future employment and possibly a second career. Eventually Broadway 
        will come back, but the skills I learn as a web developer will always be an asset and by having
        multiple irons in the fire, I hope that the work will continue even during slow and down times
        between new Broadway productions.
